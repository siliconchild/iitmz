    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        In my research, I explore biological and disease networks using multi-sensor and multi-scale data. I focus on modeling, control, optimization, and integration of (Bio-)process Manufacturing to enhance efficiency. I also investigate bioprocess control and process analytical technology for quality assurance. Additionally, I study complex man-made networks through data-driven learning and control approaches. My goal is to advance understanding and management of these networks.
