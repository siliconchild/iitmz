    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My research explores the intersections of higher education, global politics, and cultural exchange. I study how education functions as a form of soft power and how transnational collaborations, particularly between the Global South, Africa, and post-Soviet regions, shape knowledge production and identity. Drawing on critical geopolitics, decolonial theory, and comparative education, my work examines institutions, cultural diplomacy, and the pursuit of equity and liberation through education, music, and global citizenship.</p>
