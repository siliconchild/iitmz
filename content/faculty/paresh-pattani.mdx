        Dr. Pattani says "I am super excited to join IITM in Zanzibar. It is the first IIT campus outside India and the team leading this effort is really awesome and works super fast. I am a graduate of IIT Bombay with a PhD from UBC Canada and an MBA from UT Austin. I have several years of management and strategy experience from NEC and Intel. I have a challenging role of Vice President - Institutional Development at IIT Madras in Zanzibar but my experience will help. To top it all I was born and brought up in Tanzania and can speak the basic level of Kiswahili, therefore this gives me an opportunity not only to give back to IIT but also to Tanzania".
