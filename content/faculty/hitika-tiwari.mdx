<section>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on 3D face reconstruction, self-supervised learning, and image colorization. I am interested in developing robust, efficient, and interpretable vision systems that can handle challenges such as occlusion, limited supervision, and real-time constraints. My recent work explores self-supervised frameworks for monocular 3D face analysis, occlusion-resistant modeling, and object-centric video stabilization.</p>
