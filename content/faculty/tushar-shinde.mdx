    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My research interests are centered around deep learning model compression, image and video processing, and AI/ML applications. Key areas include model pruning and quantization for Edge AI, perceptual video quality assessment, motion estimation, and AI/ML solutions for remote sensing, agriculture, healthcare, speech emotion recognition, and data science.
