    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        My Research interests lie in the fields of water treatment and rural water supply. I am particularly drawn to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment, with a strong focus on wastewater reuse and recycling. Additionally, I am fascinated by the concept of bioremediation, especially in regards to contaminated soils, air, and water containing heavy metals, pesticides, and other hazardous organic compounds.
