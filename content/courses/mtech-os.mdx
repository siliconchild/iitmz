  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    The MTech in Ocean Structures program presents a rigorous and comprehensive
    curriculum designed to cultivate expertise Ocean structures covering
    Offshore Platforms for oil and Gas exploration, Renewable Energy such as
    offshore wind, wave and tidal energy, port and harbour infrastructures
    including jetties, berths, breakwater, dredging and reclamation aspects.
    Along with core courses like Wave hydrodynamics, Offshore Structures, Port
    and harbour structures and a selection of supplementary electives. There is
    a heavy emphasis on hands-on lab work cum tutorials in design of the above
    and industry driven projects. The course will enable the students to acquire
    research aptitude along with the necessary skills to succeed in the job
    market.
