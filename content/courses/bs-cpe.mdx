      Reading of autobiographical literature from Africa, India and other areas. In this module, students will analyse common elements and highlight the differences in language and structure. Practice exercises will be on writing about oneself, including intellectual development, childhood, and current experiences in an international college campus.

      Breaking down writing pieces to understand the importance of coherence, cogency and grammar. Students will be encouraged to examine principles of good writing and also to practice writing faster and more effectively.

      Communicating information visually is the subject of this module. Eschewing text, students will depict ideas and information (& data) in graphs, charts and other visual means. The practice element will be presentations made to the class, bringing together the visual and the verbal communication aspects.

      Writing longer pieces - here students till explore various kinds of writing including long personal essays and popular science articles. The module will pull together learnings from the previous ones to produce good writing.
